# HSB-Alumni
 An alumni site for former students of the Bremen University of Applied Sciences. This was a project in the fourth semester of the Hochschule Bremen in the course of studies Media Informatics. Before creating the website, an Adobe-XD prototype was created, which was then implemented with HTML, CSS and JS.
